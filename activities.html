              In the activity Señor Levadura (<strong style="color: #3a931f"
                >'Mr. Yeast’</strong
              >), students explored variables linked to ideal yeast growth and
              carbon dioxide production, experimenting with nutritional source,
              temperature, pH, and water. We helped students understand that
              microbes are living organisms that can have both positive and
              negative effects during food preparation. The experiment begins by
              dividing the students into four groups (temperature, beneficial
              environment, acidity, and nutrients). Each of these four groups
              tests specific conditions for yeast. For example, the acidity
              group focuses on what acidic conditions yeast grows in the best.
              First, three test tubes are filled with water, yeast, and sugar.
              Then, in one tube, vinegar is added to create an acidic
              environment and in another, baking soda is added to create a basic
              environment. Once the students have added each of the ingredients,
              they shake the tubes thoroughly to mix and then place a balloon on
              top of the test tube. Because yeast releases CO2 as it grows, the
              balloons inflate the most over the ideal conditions for the yeast.
              Through experimentation, the class learns that yeast prefer an
              environment of yeast, sugar, and warm water. This discovery sparks
              a discussion about living, beneficial bacteria that are present in
              many of our favorite foods from bread, to soy sauce, cheese,
              chocolate, and more!

              Misterio en la Cocina (<strong style="color: #f49346"
                >'The Kitchen Mystery'</strong
              >) is one of two Nuestra Ciencia lessons focused on food safety.
              The lesson demonstrates the danger of cross contamination and
              highlights the importance of hand washing. Students begin the
              activity by forming groups of 4-5 students. Then, each student
              chooses a color (purple, orange, pink, blue, or yellow) and an
              ingredient (bread, lettuce, ham, cheese, or cucumber). All
              students, regardless of color receive lotion to then apply on
              their hands. However, the student who chose purple receives lotion
              with GlowGerm, a UV light responsive substance, mixed in. GlowGerm
              represents contamination in the experiment. Each student then
              receives their ingredient(s). In assembly line fashion, the
              students build a sandwich, placing one ingredient on top of one
              another, and after it is completed, the UV lights are turned on
              and the students begin examining their sandwich. The ingredient
              that was touched by the student with GlowGerm will light up bright
              blue, along with the neighboring ingredients that touched the
              “contaminated” ingredient. Students are able to see that if one
              ingredient is contaminated, other ingredients can easily become
              contaminated with bacteria/germs too! Students then participate in
              a discussion with their facilitators about ways in which our hands
              and our food can become contaminated and what we can do as good
              scientists (and healthy humans) to prevent food contamination.

              Cuatro Pasos, (<strong style="color: #db3a46"
                >'Four Steps to Food Safety'</strong
              >) was a stations activity where each class was split into mini
              groups of six kids that rotated throughout four stations, learning
              a different lesson related to food safety at each one. Station
              one, or “Limpiar” is about learning the importance of cleaning
              your hands in the kitchen. The students were shown a bowl of water
              sprinkled with cinnamon, and observed as a Q-tip was dipped into
              the water, which the Q-tip then absorbs. After that, a new Q-tip
              is covered in soap, and then the cotton is submerged into the
              cinnamon water. The students’ takeaway is that soap repels the
              germs on your hands, in this case represented by the cinnamon atop
              the water. Next, they move to ‘Separar’ (separate), where they
              learn the importance of ensuring that their food doesn’t touch
              other, more transmissible food. They all sit in front of a
              microscope, and are asked to make observations about the bacteria
              colonies sitting on top of cheese. They are given 3 possible
              conditions (floor, raw chicken, none) that the cheese has been
              exposed to and then have to match based on the amount of bacteria
              they see. Then, they move to ‘Cocinar’ (Cook) where they’re taught
              that adequately high temperatures can kill bacteria. To do this,
              we assign one student to each scenario- freezer, room temperature,
              hot day, and boiling. Each scenario has a sound associated with
              it, and they’re asked to put their sticker on the laminated
              chicken each time they hear their sound (prerecorded video). The
              results show them that since no sound comes for the boiling
              scenario, bacteria can live at most temperatures until it’s too
              hot. Finally, they moved to Enfriar (freeze), which tells students
              the importance of keeping things in a freezer. They help us put
              laminated pictures of strawberries (which were left at room temp
              and are getting progressively moldier) on the board. Then, they
              compare that to pictures of a different strawberry that was left
              for the same amount of time but in the fridge. As they make their
              observations, they should notice that the strawberry from the
              fridge molds at a slower rate, which should help them understand
              that you need cold temperatures to slow microbial growth.

              unit introduces 3rd–6th grade students to vaccines and herd
              immunity through hands-on, bilingual lessons that connect science,
              math, and real-world relevance. The unit includes four activities:
              learning how vaccines protect individuals, exploring herd immunity
              through the story of a child named Pepe, a physical simulation
              game, and a graphing activity to analyze results. In the outdoor
              simulation, students participate in a safe, dodgeball-style game
              modeling how viruses spread through communities with different
              vaccination rates. Facilitators introduce Pepe and explain how
              some individuals—like him—cannot be vaccinated and rely on others
              for protection. Students represent vaccinated and unvaccinated
              people: unvaccinated students cross their arms and can’t block
              Koosh balls (representing the virus), while vaccinated students
              can. If hit, unvaccinated students move to a red zone and receive
              a red pom pom to symbolize infection. Each round shows a new
              scenario with increasing vaccination coverage. Colored visuals
              (red, blue, green) help represent different health outcomes, and
              music signals the start and end of each round. The activity ends
              with a class discussion about how vaccines help protect the whole
              community—including those who are most vulnerable.

              introduces students to the different ways plants defend themselves
              from threats like pathogens, herbivores, and environmental
              stressors. Through four interactive stations, students explore how
              plants survive without a circulatory system or adaptive immune
              system like humans. At Station 1, students learn that plants use a
              vascular system—xylem and phloem—instead of blood, and defend
              themselves with strong cell walls and the ability to isolate
              infections by killing infected cells. Station 2 explores how
              plants protect themselves from herbivores using physical barriers
              like thorns and chemical defenses. Station 3 focuses on plant
              responses to microbes, such as producing antimicrobial chemicals
              and physical barriers like waxy cuticles and bark. Students
              observe and touch real plant samples to identify these traits.
              Finally, Station 4 discusses how plants endure environmental
              stress like sun, drought, or fire through structural adaptations
              and resilience strategies. Each station includes guiding questions
              to encourage curiosity, critical thinking, and connections to how
              humans benefit from plant defense systems (e.g., medicines). This
              hands-on experience helps students understand that although plants
              are rooted in place, they are anything but defenseless.
