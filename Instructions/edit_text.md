# How to Edit Text on an HTML Page

Welcome! This guide will walk you through how to update text step-by-step. Let's go!

---

## 📁 1. Open the HTML File

First, find the file you want to edit. It'll look something like:

```
index.html  
about.html  
contact.html
```

For those less familiar with HTML you can open and edit text in Github. To edit the page in Github, just click on it. Then, once you are at the code view, click on the little pencil icon in the top right. 

---

## ✏️ 2. Find the Text You Want to Edit

Look for the part of the file that has the actual text between **angle brackets** like this:

```html
<h1>Welcome to Nuestra Ciencia!</h1>
<p>This is the text you’ll see on the page.</p>
```

The letters and numbers surrounded by angle brackets is called a tag (highlighted in blue). Tags always need an opening tag (without a slash) and a closing tag (with the slash). 

**Only edit the words between the tags**, not the tags themselves.

## ✅ 3. Example: Editing Text

Let’s say you want to change this:

```html
<p>We are always exploring — stay tuned!</p>
```

To this:

```html
<p>We are always building community — stay tuned!</p>
```

Just replace the text inside the `<p>` tags.

## 💾 4. Save Your Changes

After you edit the text in Github:
- Click the green button "Commit changes..."
- Write a commit message and description that describes what you changed
- If you want to publish your changes immediately (recommended), select "Commit directly to the main branch"
- If you want to wait until someone with more CS skills can help, select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"

## 🔗 5. Common HTML Tags You Might See

| Tag             | What It Does                            |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `<p>`           | Paragraph (normal text)                 |
| `<h1>`          | Main heading                            |
| `<h2>`          | Subheading                              |
| `<strong>`      | **Bold**                                |
| `<em>`          | *Italic*                                |
| `<a href="">`   | Link to another page or website         |
| `<ul>` + `<li>` | Bullet list                             |

## 🚨 What Not to Touch (Yet)

You’ll see things like this:

```html
<div style="..."> ... </div>
<script> ... </script>
```

These control layout and functionality. You don’t need to touch these unless you're feeling confident or working with someone who knows HTML.
