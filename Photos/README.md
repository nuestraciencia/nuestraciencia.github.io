# 📸 Photos

Welcome to the **Nuestra Ciencia** photos folder!

This directory contains images from our lessons, events, and community partnerships. These photos showcase our undergraduate mentors, the Cal Poly Learn By Doing Lab (LBDL), and the exciting microbiology activities we share with local K–12 students.
